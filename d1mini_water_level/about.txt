Water Level Sensor

After 8 consecutive readings over the threshold, you can trigger an action. 
This cuts down on the wacky readings from the ultrasonic sensor causing false positives.

In this case, the action that is triggered is publishing a message to an MQTT topic
and turning on a pump controlled by esp32_main. This pump will fill the reservoir 
until the HC-SR04 sensor stops registering low water levels. at which it will 
publish another message to the same MQTT topic and turn off the pump.* 

* This is highly speculative.
