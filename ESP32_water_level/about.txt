Tested on ESP32 Generic NodeMCU style dev board.

Water Level Sensor

After 8 consecutive readings over the threshold, you can trigger an action. 
This cuts down on the wacky readings from the ultrasonic sensor causing false positives.

In this case, the action that is triggered is publishing a message to an MQTT topic
and turning on a pump controlled by MainLand ESP32. This pump will fill the reservoir 
until the HC-SR04 sensor stops registering low water levels. at which it will 
publish another message to the same MQTT topic and turn off the pump.* 

Line 37 of main.py:

  threshold_count = 0  # Leave this at 0 - it is the counter.
  threshold = 8 # Number of consecutive events required to trigger action 
  distance_threshold = 14 # Distance threshold that triggers the count towards an action.

Line 57 of main.py:

  if distance_cm() < 12: # Distance that needs to register in order to turn off pump.

FIX:
The high water mark should have its own counter. The sensor will also give false positives
below the threshold and trigger the pump to stop. But it seems like the pump turns on 
immediately again until the desired high water mark is truly reset by multiple readings. 
Its sloppy but it works. 


* This is highly speculative.
